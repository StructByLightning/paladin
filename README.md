This is a demo feed of the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us) using their open API.

Note that the app is entirely clientside. This means that the API key is available in the source code. This is highly insecure and I only did it this way because this is a demo and the key is freely available (so there's no point in anyone stealing it).

# Installation
After cloning, run `npm install` in the downloaded directory, then `npm start`. The app will be available at localhost:3000
